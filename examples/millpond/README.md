## Overview

MillPond is the **first and reference implementation** of the PACE pattern. It's a conversational storefront where an AI guide named **Cormorant** helps users discover MCP servers, tools, playbooks, and reports through natural conversation.

MillPond demonstrates all four PACE principles in production:
- ✅ **Proactive** — Animated greeting, inactivity prompts, social proof
- ✅ **Adaptive** — Dynamic pills, expertise detection, varied entry points
- ✅ **Contextual** — Executive Summary panel, conversation memory, transparent reasoning
- ✅ **Efficient** — Quick-access pills, clear actions, animated feedback

## Latest Features (December 2025)

A live-updating panel showing what Cormorant has learned about user needs in real-time.

**Why it matters:**
- **Trust**: Users see exactly what the AI knows
- **Correction**: Misunderstandings get fixed early
- **Transparency**: No black-box recommendations
- **Collaboration**: Feels like working together

### 2. Animated Cormorant Guide 🐦

**The bird that flies** — creating brand stickiness through delightful animation.

- **On Page Load**: Flies in from off-screen
- **While Idle**: Gentle breathing animation
- **While Thinking**: Side-to-side searching motion
- **On Success**: Excited flutter
- **Easter Egg**: Loop-de-loop when user types "fly"

> *"This isn't just whimsy—it's brand stickiness. People will remember 'the site with the bird that flies.'"*
